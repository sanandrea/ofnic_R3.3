Welcome to the OFNIC network information & control platform.   This distribution
includes all the software you need to build, install, and deploy this GE in
your network, as well as source code and tools to allow you to develop
your own NetIC API based applications.

OFNIC relies on OpenFlow as the communication protocol for controlling
switches and SNMP as the protocol to retrieve network statistics.
